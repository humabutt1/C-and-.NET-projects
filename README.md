ShippingQuoteCalculator project: https://github.com/humabutt1/ShippingQuoteCalculator.git
This is a simple console application built to calculate shipping estimates for packages using basic input from the user. It checks whether the package meets weight and size limits before calculating the shipping cost based on a standard formula. The program is designed for a fictional service called Package Express, making it a helpful tool for learning user input, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations in C#.
